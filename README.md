# Important Information

<b>Bookmarks:</b>

⚠️When Downloading the ZIP From the Releases, The bookmarks.json file, must Be Manually Put into the DIST Folder With the EXE File that is Already in it.⚠️

Bookmarks are Accessed Via a JSON File, that Means that You Have to Manualy Make and/or Edit the JSON File Yourself, or Replace the JSON File with an Exported one. You Can Use [This Website](https://bookmarks-file-maker-13880131.codehs.me/index.html) to Make a Bookmarks List and Export it, or You Can Export Your Bookmarks from Chrome or Firefox. Once You Export it Replace the bookmarks.json file that is in your extracted folder, or you can save the file in place of the original when exporting.

<b>Tabs:</b>

~~The Titles on the Tabs Do not Work at the Moment, so All Tabs Will Say "New Tab" Unless it is a Built in Page.~~ This Issue Is Fixed in The Latest Code Update!
